# Predicting Malware with Random Forest

## Purpose

After using logistic regression, SVM, KNN, and decision tree models with malware data, I am going to see how a random forest model performs with the data.

## Steps

1. Declare a `RandomForestClassifier()` model. Use the following settings: `n_estimators=128` and `random_state=78`

2. Fit the training data to the model, and save the model.

3. Evaluate the model by making predictions with the testing data to get the accuracy score.

4. Get the model's feature importances and list the top ten most important features.

5. Things to think about:

   * Would I trust this model to detect malware?

   * Out of the following models, which one had the highest accuracy score: logistic regression, SVM, KNN, decision tree, or random forest?
